      I love penguins. They are by far the coolest creatures on planet Earth.
      Anyway, My assignment for this project was to create a website about
      anything, as long as it followed a particular style. I decided to use
      React and my own JSS code for this website. I could've used HTML and SCSS
      as well since this is just a one page site.

      The design was the most important part of this project. I made sure
      everything looked aesthetically pleasing. Every image has a subtle purple
      gradient that gives the design plenty of contrast. At the bottom of the
      site, you can see a penguin I created using only CSS!

      If I were to do this project over, I would probably not use React. I got a
      bit caught up in using React for everything and this project really didn't
      need it. A one page site that doesn't get its content from any CMS isn't
      somewhere React code should be.

      Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with this project. It came out a lot better than
      I was expecting.
