      For our Senior Portfolio assignment at Colchester High School, I created a
      website showing off some of my best works. I included my old portfolio,
      Euterpe, and Dionysus.

      For this website I used React, Material-UI and Gatsby. Gatsby lets you
      create React based websites but it has the ability to use a CMS as well. I
      don't retrieve data from anywhere in this website though. Instead, I
      created seperate React components for each page. Gatsby made this easier
      by automatically linking to components by their file names. For example,
      the url "best-works" would automatically link the component called
      "BestWorks.js".

      If I were to do this project over, I would have used a CMS (such as the
      Netlify CMS). This way, I could have put of all of my writing on that CMS
      and retrieved the data from my website. This is what Gatsby was, among
      other things, designed for.

      Overall, Iâ€™m pretty happy with this project. I learned some of the core
      mechanics of Gatsby which will help me later if I decide to create a
      React-based website that retrieves its data from a live CMS.
